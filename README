This code is started with an objective to develop 'Paparazzi' application for iPhone as mentioned by CS193P. See the pdf "Assignment%204_Paparazzi1-1.pdf" file.
currently it is in intermediate state and will be re-written after i will be thorough with the concepts.

Here we dont have stuff like contacts etc. but we do have a simple Navigation and tab bar controllers to set up correctly.

In current phase, the application crashes when we go from full screen view directly to the main navigation controller view by pressing the tab button twice. I am not aware of the problem and i intend to fix it.
